MCP BM LAB03, see [1]

This environment is designed to test ovs-dpdk, but can be used for
testing other models that fit the nodes in this lab.

Lab contains the following hosts:

kvm01: cz8113.bud.mirantis.net
kvm02: cz7168.bud.mirantis.net
kvm03: cz7169.bud.mirantis.net
cmp001: cz7395.bud.mirantis.net
cmp002: cz7166.bud.mirantis.net
gtw01: cz7636.bud.mirantis.net
gtw02: cz7637.bud.mirantis.net

reclass.storage definitions that are created from the cluster model
after the first salt-inventory generation and placed to init.yml here.

To create a new 'environmet' model with additional classes is used reclass_tools [2]
while the 'environment' model is at the PoC stage.
